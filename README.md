## 📖 Project Overview

**Urban+** is a modern **Urban Tracking System** designed for the residents of Ankara. It allows citizens to report local urban issues (potholes, lighting failures, environmental pollution, etc.) using a map-based interface, while enabling municipality teams to track and manage these reports via a secure administrative dashboard.

The primary objective is to bridge the gap between citizens and the **Ankara Metropolitan Municipality**, fostering a participatory approach to city management using modern web technologies and geospatial visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React 18 (Vite) | High-performance user interface & component management |
| **Mapping** | React Leaflet | Map rendering, markers, and spatial interaction |
| **Backend (BaaS)** | Firebase | Authentication, Hosting, and Serverless functions |
| **Database** | Firestore (NoSQL) | Real-time data syncing for reports and user profiles |
| **Storage** | Firebase Storage | Hosting user-uploaded images (evidence photos) |
| **Routing** | React Router v6 | Protected routes and navigation guards |
| **Styling** | CSS Modules / Styled | Responsive design aligned with ABB corporate identity |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Urban+ follows a **Serverless Architecture** where the frontend handles all client-side logic and spatial rendering, while Firebase acts as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) provider.

* **Authentication Layer:** Firebase Auth handles Identity Management (IDM) and role verification (Guest vs. Admin).
* **Data Layer:** Firestore stores report metadata, geolocation points, and status updates in real-time.
* **Media Layer:** Images uploaded by citizens are optimized and stored in Firebase Storage buckets.
* **Presentation Layer:** React components render the map and dashboard, communicating with Firebase via the Web SDK.

## 👤  User Roles & Access Control

### 1. Guest (Visitor)
* **View Access:** Can view the interactive map and browse existing urban reports.
* **Filtering:** Can filter reports by category (e.g., Road) to see issues in specific neighborhoods.
* **Restriction:** Cannot report new issues, upload photos, or access the admin panel.

### 2. Citizen (Authenticated User)
* **Report Issues:** Can use the "Drop Pin" feature to submit new urban issues with precise location data.
* **Upload Evidence:** Can attach real-time photos to their reports using Firebase Storage integration.
* **Track Status:** Can monitor their submitted reports to see if they are marked as "In Progress" or "Resolved".
* **Manage Own Data:** Can delete their own reports if they were submitted in error (before admin intervention).

### 3. Admin (Municipality Staff)
* **Full Control:** Secure access to the Admin Dashboard with advanced management tools.
* **Status Management:** Authority to update the lifecycle of a report (Open → In Progress → Resolved).
* **Internal Feedback:** Can add "Admin Notes" to specific reports for internal team communication and task delegation.
* **Moderation:** Can delete inappropriate, duplicate, or resolved reports from any user to maintain data quality.
